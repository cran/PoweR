	-> Anderson-Darling statistic, in R and C, for some sample sizes and some levels
	-> Watson U^2 statistic, in R and C, for some sample sizes and some levels

Version 0.1.2

-> Added testseuils.R function to build P-values and P-disp plots
   These function are still incomplete
   Morerover, some already implemented test statistics will need better level definition
