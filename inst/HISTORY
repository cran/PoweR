Version 0.1.1 : 

-> Added some statistics for testing uniformity :
	-> Characteristic function based test statistic, solely in R, work still in progress
	-> Lagrange Multiplier statistic LM, in R and C, complete
	-> Neyman smooth test of order 4, in R and C, complete
	-> Anderson-Darling statistic, in R and C, for some sample sizes and some levels
	-> Watson U^2 statistic, in R and C, for some sample sizes and some levels
-> Added 20 distributions alternative to uniformty in order to perform power tests on the previously listed statistics

-> Added plotpuiss.R function to write power/sample size graphs in external files

Version 0.1.2

-> Added testseuils.R function to build P-values and P-disp plots
   These function are still incomplete
   Morerover, some already implemented test statistics will need better level definition

Version 0.1.3

-> Updated testseuils.R with functions quanttest and pvaltest to build
   respectively QQ-plots and P-values plot.
-> Updated statistics definitions in defstats.R with p-values when available and 
   standard string if not.

Version 1.0

--> First submission to CRAN

2013-11-02
----------

Version 1.0.1

-> I added a sub(".txt") call to correct a bug on computation of examples 
   variable in file power.gui.R that prevented a correct use of Examples tab in the GUI
-> I added a dontCheck call to prevent a NOTE about a Registration problem in a .C call (e.g., symbol ‘name.law’ in the local frame), 
   in files getnbparlaws.R, getnbparstats.R and getindex.R. I also modified a few other R files for the same reason.
-> I corrected a bug in the C++ file stat80.cpp
