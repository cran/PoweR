Version 0.1 : First version of package PoweR

2009-09-01
----------

Version 0.1.1 : 

-> Added some statistics for testing uniformity :
	-> Characteristic function based test statistic, solely in R, work still in progress
	-> Lagrange Multiplier statistic LM, in R and C, complete
	-> Neyman smooth test of order 4, in R and C, complete
	-> Anderson-Darling statistic, in R and C, for some sample sizes and some levels
	-> Watson U^2 statistic, in R and C, for some sample sizes and some levels
-> Added 20 distributions alternative to uniformty in order to perform power tests on the previously listed statistics

-> Added plotpuiss.R function to write power/sample size graphs in external files

----------

Version 0.1.2

-> Added testseuils.R function to build P-values and P-disp plots
   These function are still incomplete
   Morerover, some already implemented test statistics will need better level definition

2009-09-25
----------

Version 0.1.3

-> Updated testseuils.R with functions quanttest and pvaltest to build
   respectively QQ-plots and P-values plot.
-> Updated statistics definitions in defstats.R with p-values when available and 
   standard string if not.

Version 1.0

--> First submission to CRAN

2013-11-02
----------

Version 1.0.1

-> I added a sub(".txt") call to correct a bug on computation of examples 
   variable in file power.gui.R that prevented a correct use of Examples tab in the GUI
-> I added a dontCheck call to prevent a NOTE about a Registration problem in a .C call (e.g., symbol ‘name.law’ in the local frame), 
   in files getnbparlaws.R, getnbparstats.R and getindex.R. I also modified a few other R files for the same reason.
-> I corrected a bug in the C++ file stat80.cpp

2014-07-17
----------

Version 1.0.2

-> I added a warning in the file pvalueMC.R to warn users for an incorrect choice of the argument 'alter' leading to a reseting of it.

2014-11-21
----------

Version 1.0.4

-> I modified slightly the many.crit.Rd file
-> I modified the file calcpuissRcpp.cpp

2015-08-17
----------

Version 1.0.5

-> I modified files stat37.cpp, stat38.cpp, stat39.cpp to add the test statistics of my new article with A. Desgagne
-> I corrected file stat32.cpp (Martinez-Iglewicz)
-> I corrected file stat31.cpp (Epps-Pulley that should reject for small values of the test statistic)
-> I corrected an incorrect use of the function is.loaded() to check if some packages are loaded
-> I modified the file stat16.cpp (use the new version of mc_C_d from robustbase package, and also change the way I call it).
-> I corrected the value of M present in the output (of powcomp.fast()) when using several cores (nbclus > 1). This had side effect on the display of the tables of power.
-> I modified a lot of (R and C++) files to enable the centering/scaling of the data generated, in several functions
-> I modified file powcomp-fast.R (problem with parstat)
-> I replaced (in the cpp files) all the calls to pnorm or pnorm5 into Rf_pnorm5
-> I modified the file register.cpp
-> I modified the C function powcompfast to enable computation of quantiles through the compquant argument. This function will be called by the many.crit R function
